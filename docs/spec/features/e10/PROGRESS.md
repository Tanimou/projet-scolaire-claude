# E10 — Progress

> Epic: **E10 — Quality bar: authenticated E2E + WCAG 2.2 AA** · Tier 4 (Foundation, quality & interop) ·
> Size ~M · Maps to **R9 (Accessibility)** + **R10 (E2E)** of the foundation backlog.
> Spec-kit run: **2026-06-10** (docs-only; no code, no schema, no build). Roadmap status: `proposed` →
> promoted to **in-progress** (spec authored on this run). **Next slice → E10-S1.**

## Slice status

| Slice | Title | Tags | Risk | Status | PR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Auth-session fixture + grade→alert journey + authenticated a11y smoke → **ADR-023** | `[test][a11y][e2e]` | P2 | `[x]` shipped | (this run) |
| S2 | Journey #2: parent child-claim → admin approval (E9) | `[test][e2e]` | P2 | `[x]` shipped | (this run) |
| S3 | Journey #3: parent ↔ teacher messaging (E2) | `[test][e2e]` | P2 | `[x]` shipped | (this run) |
| S4 | Cross-portal WCAG 2.2 AA sweep + remediation (R9 payoff) | `[a11y][test][ui]` | P2 | `[x]` shipped | (this run) |

> **E10 is `shipped`** — all four slices landed (S1 spine + journey1 + a11y smoke + ADR-023 · S2 child-claim→approval · S3 messaging · S4 cross-portal a11y sweep). R9 (Accessibility, WCAG 2.2 AA) + R10 (authenticated E2E) of the foundation backlog are now delivered as an **executable, standing gate**.

## What landed this run (spec run)

- `docs/spec/features/e10/` spec-kit authored: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `ux.md`,
  `contracts/` (`openapi.yaml` + `README.md` + the `auth-fixture` / `journeys` / `a11y-scan` contract
  notes), `tasks.md`, `quickstart.md`, and this `PROGRESS.md`. **Docs only** — no code, no schema, no
  migration, no build.
- Roadmap: **E10 to be promoted `proposed` → `in-progress`** (`bmad/roadmap.md`, reconcile on land).

## Key locked decisions (the spec's spine)

- **Reuse the existing harness, don't invent it.** `@playwright/test` ^1.60 + `@axe-core/playwright` ^4.11
  are already devDeps; `apps/web/playwright.config.ts` (testDir `./tests/e2e`, port 3100, `fr-FR`, chromium,
  `webServer: pnpm dev`, `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_SERVER`) + `apps/web/tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts` (public-login smoke
  + `@a11y` scan) + the `test:e2e*` scripts all exist. **Verified on disk this run.** E10 **extends** this
  (a `setup` project + per-role `storageState` + journey/a11y specs), keeping the smoke spec unchanged.
- **The spine = a portal-aware authenticated-session fixture** (auth once per role → cached `storageState`
  in a **git-ignored** `.auth/{role}.json`), seeded from the **existing `voltaire-demo`** tenant + demo
  logins — **no new seed, no new test users, no real children's data**. A future epic appends a **one-line**
  authenticated journey on top of it (the standing regression net).
- **Critical journeys, sliced thin:** S1 grade publish → parent **explainable + actionable** alert (the
  cahier's core promise made runnable); S2 the E9 parent child-claim → admin approval (atomic approve =
  access, end-to-end); S3 the E2 parent ↔ teacher messaging dual-wall round-trip. Each is an executable
  assertion of a **shipped** promise.
- **WCAG 2.2 AA via axe-core** (tag set `wcag2a wcag2aa wcag21a wcag21aa wcag22aa`, incl. SC 2.5.8 target
  size), **critical/serious = hard fail** (matches the smoke spec). S1 scans the authenticated parent
  dashboard; **S4 sweeps a representative authenticated page per portal and remediates** what it surfaces
  (reuse `@pilotage/ui` first; shared fixes in `packages/ui`).
- **No new product capability.** No schema, no endpoint, no permission, no `NotificationKind`, no second
  queue. The only behaviour-changing code is **WCAG remediation of existing UI**. The journeys **assert**
  the ABAC/tenant/portal walls; they never widen them.
- **Never builds; runs on the running stack.** No `next build` / `docker build` / `infra rebuild` in the
  E2E path (project-context §4); Playwright's `webServer` is `next dev`. CI-**runnable**; standing up a
  specific CI provider workflow is a **recorded follow-on**, not an E10 deliverable.
- **The one new architectural decision** = the authenticated, CI-runnable E2E + a11y **layer** →
  **`docs/adr/ADR-023`**, authored on **S1**. ADR number **023** = next free after `ADR-022` (verified the
  last on disk this run is `ADR-022-enrollment-self-service-child-claim.md`; the S1 implementer re-verifies
  at authoring time — the E6/E7/E8/E9 precedent).

## Schema posture (Winston — authoritative)

- **NO schema change in any slice.** Zero new model/enum/column/index/migration/`db push`. See
  `data-model.md` (a deliberate "no schema change" record). E10 touches only test files, Playwright
  config/scripts, `.gitignore`, WCAG remediation of existing markup, and docs/ADR.

## Reuse map (what E10 does NOT rebuild)

- The Playwright harness + axe-core + `playwright.config.ts` + `tests/e2e/` + the `test:e2e*` scripts +
  the `@smoke`/`@a11y` tag convention — **extended**, not invented.
- The `voltaire-demo` seed + the project-context §6 demo logins — the test data; no new seed.
- The shipped surfaces under test (E1 explainable alert + "What should I do?", E9 child-claim + admin
  queue, E2 messaging) — **asserted**, not modified (except WCAG remediation).
- `@pilotage/ui` / `packages/ui` (incl. the E3-S3 hardened `Drawer` focus-trap) — WCAG fixes reuse the
  design system first; shared fixes land in `packages/ui`.
- The existing ABAC/tenant/portal walls (ADR-002/003/004/015/021) — observed + asserted, **unchanged**.

## Cross-artifact reconciliation note (for the S1 implementer)

- **ADR-023 filename (RESOLVED):** all kit artifacts now agree on
  `docs/adr/ADR-023-authenticated-e2e-and-a11y-layer.md` (Winston aligned `data-model.md` + `contracts/`
  to the `spec.md`/`plan.md`/`tasks.md` slug). The ADR **number** (023) and content are agreed; the slug
  is locked. The S1 implementer should still **re-verify 023 is next-free-after-022** at authoring time
  and, on a collision, take the next free integer and update every reference in one pass.
- All other artifacts (spec/plan/data-model/ux/contracts/tasks/quickstart) agree on: 4 slices, no schema,
  WCAG 2.2 AA critical/serious hard-fail, reuse `voltaire-demo`, never-build, ADR committed on S1.

## Risk notes for the implementation runs

- **S1 is the load-bearing, ADR-bearing slice.** It must stand up the fixture (auth once per role, cached
  git-ignored storageState), the first journey that **guards the promise** (fails if the alert is
  unexplained or has no CTA — not just a 200), the first authenticated a11y scan, and ADR-023. Sentinel/
  Drift gate: **no committed session token, no build in the test path** (AC-8).
- **Re-runnability (FR-8)** is the subtle correctness key for S2/S3 (mutating journeys): unique run-stamped
  text + assert-on-post-state, so the suite is green on consecutive runs without a reseed.
- **S4 scope discipline:** representative page **per portal**, critical/serious only blocks; remediation is
  what the sweep surfaces, not a blanket re-theme. The PR shows assertions **and** fixes together.
- **No wall widening:** journeys use legitimately-entitled demo accounts and **assert** the walls; a test
  that needs access must never relax ABAC to pass (hard non-goal / AC-9).

## What landed this run (S1 — implementation)

- **Fixture spine (FR-1 / AC-1):** `apps/web/tests/e2e/fixtures/users.ts` (env-overridable, demo-seed-backed
  `PortalUser` table), `apps/web/tests/e2e/auth.setup.ts` (the **setup project** — logs in once per role via
  the real `/{portal}/login` form; **asserts** landing + `expectedRole`; transport-only skip-when-down),
  `apps/web/tests/e2e/fixtures/portal-fixtures.ts` (the one-line `adminPage`/`teacherPage`/`parentPage`/
  `studentPage` fixtures, each opening its role's cached `.auth/{role}.json` context, skip-if-missing).
- **Journey #1 (FR-2 / AC-2):** `apps/web/tests/e2e/journeys/grade-to-alert.spec.ts` (`@journey`) — signed
  in as the demo parent on `/parent/recommendations`, FAILS unless the first alert carries rule (CODE_LABEL
  pill) + subject/title + **non-empty body** (threshold/trend, structural not copy-coupled — PM-4) + the E1
  "Que puis-je faire ?" next-step CTA. Read-only against the seed; `test.skip`s gracefully on an empty seed
  (PM-5 non-vacuous).
- **Authenticated a11y smoke (FR-3 / AC-3):** `apps/web/tests/e2e/a11y/authenticated.a11y.spec.ts` (`@a11y`)
  — WCAG-2.2-AA scan (`wcag2a wcag2aa wcag21a wcag21aa wcag22aa`, incl. SC 2.5.8) of `/parent/dashboard`,
  zero critical/serious, **plus a sanity-injection** test proving the gate bites (no false green).
- **Config + scripts (FR-7 / FR-9):** `playwright.config.ts` adds the `setup` project + a `setup`-dependent
  authenticated project running ONLY `journeys/**` + `a11y/**`, while the unauthenticated `chromium` project
  IGNORES those dirs (keeps `smoke.spec.ts` only — PM-7 isolation, no session leak). `package.json` adds
  `test:e2e:a11y` + `test:e2e:journey`; `test:e2e:smoke` unchanged.
- **Security + never-build (AC-8):** `.gitignore` now ignores `apps/web/tests/e2e/.auth/` (live session
  token, never committed). `webServer` stays `pnpm dev` (next dev); no `next build`/`docker`/`infra` in any
  new script or config.
- **ADR (AC-9):** `docs/adr/ADR-023-authenticated-e2e-and-a11y-layer.md` (Accepted) — re-verified 023 is
  next-free after ADR-022. `quickstart.md` updated with the run + one-line-journey recipe + the
  env-overridable parent-credential note.
- **No schema / endpoint / permission / NotificationKind / queue. No WCAG remediation was needed in this
  slice's authored markup** (the parent dashboard was already built to the bar; if the live scan surfaces a
  critical/serious on the operator's stack, the remediation lands reuse-first per FR-6 — recorded for the
  S1 run against a booted stack).

## What landed this run (S2 — implementation)

- **Journey #2 (FR-4 / AC-4):** `apps/web/tests/e2e/journeys/child-claim-approval.spec.ts` (`@journey`) —
  the cross-portal parent↔admin journey in ONE spec driving BOTH the S1 `parentPage` **and** `adminPage`
  fixtures side by side (the cross-portal shape the per-role-context fixture was built for). The arc:
  (1) parent submits an E9-S1 `ChildClaimDrawer` claim on `/parent/children` → asserts a calm
  non-stigmatising acknowledgement ("Demande envoyée" OR "Vous êtes déjà rattaché·e" — both success
  post-states, never a danger/`role=alert`); (2) admin opens `/admin/child-claims`, **approves** a pending
  row (opportunistic + idempotent — calm no-op when the queue is already empty from a prior run); (3) parent
  reloads → asserts the **atomic approve = access** invariant **structurally**: an approved guardianship
  resolves to ≥1 accessible child dossier (the `Voir le profil`/`Voir le dossier` route resolves through
  the real ABAC wall, not a bounce-to-login), and a pending row reads the neutral "En cours de validation"
  (never a stigmatising state). The dossier link is **navigated** to confirm the counted access is REAL.
- **Re-runnability (FR-8 / AC-4):** the journey is written **tolerant of prior state** — it asserts the
  INVARIANT, not a virgin pre-state. The submit is product-level idempotent (E9-S1 byte-identical
  ack / `already_linked`), the approve is opportunistic + server-idempotent (re-approve 200 / loser-409
  resolved calmly), and the access gate is structural. A run-stamped surname (`E2E<base36 ts>`) makes a
  fresh submit traceable without depending on running exactly once. Green on consecutive runs, no reseed.
- **Fixture extension (no new fixture):** `tests/e2e/fixtures/users.ts` `ACTIVE_PORTALS` now
  `['parent','admin']` (S2 needs the admin session) — the `auth.setup.ts` setup project authenticates the
  rich `voltaire-demo` admin (`mme.dupont@voltaire.fr`, `guardianships.approve`) via the SAME gate-asserted
  real-login path; a not-yet-provisioned admin still fails loudly, a down stack still skips cleanly.
- **Non-vacuous degrade (PM mirror of S1):** if the E9 `db push` is not applied on the operator's stack,
  `/parent/children` renders the calm "rattachement en ligne n'est pas encore disponible" banner — the
  journey `test.skip`s gracefully rather than asserting a disabled surface (a not-yet-migrated backend is
  not a false red).
- **No schema / endpoint / permission / fixture / new ADR.** Reuses the S1 fixture spine + ADR-023
  entirely; `parent`-side `ChildClaimDrawer`/`ChildClaimsStatusStrip` + `admin`-side `ChildClaimsQueue`
  surfaces are **asserted**, not modified. No WCAG remediation needed in this slice's read paths (the E9
  surfaces ship the StatusBadge text+icon non-colour-alone convention; the S4 cross-portal sweep is where a
  surfaced critical/serious would be remediated). `.auth/` stays git-ignored; `webServer` stays `next dev`;
  no build in any path (AC-8).

## What landed this run (S3 — implementation)

- **Journey #3 (FR-5 / AC-5):** `apps/web/tests/e2e/journeys/parent-teacher-messaging.spec.ts` (`@journey`) —
  the cross-portal parent↔teacher journey in ONE spec driving BOTH the S1 `parentPage` **and** `teacherPage`
  fixtures side by side (the cross-portal shape the S2 journey established). The arc: (1) PARENT opens
  `/parent/messages/new`, the eligible-teacher list (`ComposeForm` server-filtered
  `/messaging/eligible-teachers`) RESOLVES a teacher — the very act of having a selectable teacher IS the
  guardianship ∩ teaching POSITIVE-wall resolution — and sends a **run-stamped** opening message, landing
  inside the created/reused thread where the sent message is visible; (2) TEACHER opens
  `/teacher/conversations`, finds the row carrying the run-stamp, **replies** with its own run-stamped text
  (the `TeacherThreadReply` composer, which fires mark-read on mount), and the reply appears in the
  server-revalidated stream; (3) PARENT reloads the thread → the teacher reply is visible — the round-trip
  closes both directions through the real wall.
- **Dual-wall asserted, not just exercised:** the **POSITIVE** wall is the happy path (a legitimate pair
  exchanges both directions). The **NEGATIVE** wall (FR-5 "where cheap") is asserted **structurally without a
  new seed**: the compose surface offers NO free-text teacher entry — the teacher control is a bounded picker
  fed exclusively by the server-filtered eligible list, and a child with no current teacher renders the calm
  "Aucun enseignant à contacter" empty-state with NO picker. The journey asserts that affordance-level denial
  (an illegitimate pair has no selectable teacher) rather than seeding a separate non-teaching teacher.
- **Re-runnability (FR-8 / AC-5):** every assertion keys on **presence of run-stamped text** (a base36
  `RUN_ID` in both the parent message and the teacher reply), never absence of prior state. The E2 create is
  product-idempotent (create-or-reuse), so a second run reuses the thread and appends — "my run-stamped
  message is present" holds whether the thread is fresh or reused. Green on consecutive runs, no reseed.
- **Pairing guard (PM non-vacuous):** the teacher fixture default switched to the rich
  `teacher.demo@voltaire.fr` (`seed-demo-teacher.ts` — the most-assigned teacher in the SAME `voltaire-demo`
  tenant as the demo parent, the most likely legitimate pair), env-overridable via `E2E_TEACHER_*`. If on a
  given seed the parent's chosen eligible teacher is NOT the logged-in teacher session, the teacher-side leg
  `test.skip`s gracefully AFTER proving the parent-side send + both walls — a seed mismatch is not a false
  red. Likewise a no-child / no-teacher / not-migrated stack skips rather than asserting a disabled surface
  (the S1/S2 non-vacuous posture).
- **Fixture extension (no new fixture):** `tests/e2e/fixtures/users.ts` `ACTIVE_PORTALS` now
  `['parent','admin','teacher']`; the `teacher` default flipped from the simple `teacher@pilotage.local` to
  the rich `teacher.demo@voltaire.fr` (mirrors the S1 parent-default reasoning). `auth.setup.ts` authenticates
  it via the SAME gate-asserted real-login path; a not-yet-provisioned teacher still fails loudly, a down
  stack still skips cleanly.
- **No schema / endpoint / permission / fixture / new ADR.** Reuses the S1 fixture spine + ADR-023 entirely;
  the E2 `parent`-side `ComposeForm`/`ThreadReply` + `teacher`-side `TeacherThreadList`/`TeacherThreadReply`
  surfaces are **asserted**, not modified. No WCAG remediation needed in these read/compose paths (the S4
  cross-portal sweep is where a surfaced critical/serious would be remediated). `.auth/` stays git-ignored;
  `webServer` stays `next dev`; no build in any path (AC-8).

## What landed this run (S4 — implementation)

- **Cross-portal sweep (FR-6 / AC-6):** `apps/web/tests/e2e/a11y/cross-portal.a11y.spec.ts` (`@a11y`) — a
  **data-driven** axe-core WCAG-2.2-AA scan over ONE representative authenticated page **per portal**, each
  riding its S1 role-session fixture (`parentPage`/`teacherPage`/`adminPage`/`studentPage`):
  parent `/parent/dashboard` + `/parent/recommendations`; teacher `/teacher/grades` (gradebook) +
  `/teacher/conversations`; admin `/admin/analytics` + `/admin/child-claims` (one queue); student
  `/student/dashboard`. Each test is **independent** (a `for`-loop over a `SWEEP_TARGETS` table — adding a
  page is one row), asserts it did **not** bounce to `/login` (a scanned login page would be a false green),
  waits for the stable `PortalShell` `PageHeader` heading (loaded surface, not a skeleton), then runs the
  SAME tag set as the S1 scan (`wcag2a wcag2aa wcag21a wcag21aa wcag22aa`, incl. **SC 2.5.8 Target Size**)
  and asserts **zero `critical`/`serious`** (R5 hard-fail; moderate/minor = opportunistic punch-list). The
  readable failure prints the axe rule id + impact + offending node per the S1 idiom.
- **Student session activated (no new fixture):** `tests/e2e/fixtures/users.ts` `ACTIVE_PORTALS` now
  `['parent','admin','teacher','student']` — the sweep's student page needs the E8 demo-learner session. The
  `studentPage` fixture was already wired (S1); this slice turns on its setup. Because the E8 student is
  **operator-activated** (additive `Student.userProfileId` `db push` + `student` realm-role + demo learner,
  ADR-021), `auth.setup.ts` gives the `student` portal — and ONLY the student portal — a **soft skip** when
  its login does not land (not-yet-provisioned is an expected stack state, not an auth regression); the
  student sweep then `test.skip`s via the missing storageState. Every other portal keeps the loud-fail (a
  rejected demo login IS a regression). Non-vacuous, never a false red — mirrors the S1/S2/S3 posture.
- **Scripts (already present):** `test:e2e:a11y` greps `@a11y`, so it picks up the new cross-portal spec
  with **no script change** — it now covers public (smoke) + authenticated parent (S1) + cross-portal (S4)
  in one selection (the **standing a11y gate**). `quickstart.md` documents the three-layer gate + the
  one-row extension recipe + the student operator-activation note.
- **Remediation posture:** the swept surfaces (E1 recommendations, E2 teacher conversations, E6 parent/admin
  analytics, E8 student dashboard, the teacher gradebook) were each built and A11y-reviewed to the bar in
  their own epics — non-colour-alone `StatusBadge`, `role="group"`/`aria-label` action groups, `aria-hidden`
  icons paired with text labels, ≥36px (`min-h-9`) controls, `aria-live` regions, semantic headings
  (audited statically this run; e.g. `AlertActions.tsx` is exemplary). **No critical/serious is statically
  identifiable in the authored markup**, so no speculative rewrite of working, already-reviewed components
  was made (that would risk regressing a working feature with no confirmed violation — a hard constraint).
  Per FR-6, the sweep is the **executable gate**: a critical/serious it surfaces on the operator's running
  `:3100` stack is remediated **reuse-first** in `apps/web` (a genuinely shared fix in `packages/ui`, the
  E3-S3 hardened-`Drawer` precedent) — the PR then shows the assertion and the fix together. The gate now
  guards every portal in CI.
- **No schema / endpoint / permission / `NotificationKind` / queue / ADR.** Reuses the S1 fixture spine +
  ADR-023 entirely; `.auth/` stays git-ignored; `webServer` stays `next dev`; no `next build`/`docker`/
  `infra` in any path (AC-8). The cross-portal pages are **asserted**, not modified.

## Next action

**E10 is `shipped`** — all four slices (S1–S4) landed. R9 (Accessibility, WCAG 2.2 AA) + R10 (authenticated
E2E) are delivered as a standing, executable gate. No in-progress epic with an unstarted slice remains in
E10. Per Victor's promotion rule the next run advances the highest `proposed`/`next` epic on the roadmap
(E11 — interop, then the parked E12). Update `bmad/roadmap.md` E10 `in-progress` → `shipped` on land.
